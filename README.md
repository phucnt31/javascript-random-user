## Introduction

- The Random User Generator is an AJAX-based application that utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve and display randomly generated user information from an external API. The application generates a random user upon loading and provides a button to toggle the display of a new random user without requiring a page refresh. This project demonstrates the integration of AJAX and the Fetch API to dynamically fetch and update user data.
